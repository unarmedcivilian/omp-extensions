/*
 * display.ts — the grid's render list (ADR 0006 §3).
 *
 * `ContextMap` no longer maps `blocks` 1:1. It renders the rows this pure function
 * produces. A group has THREE display states (the redesign):
 *
 *   COLLAPSED  — folded && !peeked → ONE parent tile standing in for the whole range.
 *   PEEK       — folded &&  peeked → an open row; members shown DULL (preview only). The
 *                wire is UNCHANGED (the group is still folded), so the model's context is
 *                byte-for-byte identical to COLLAPSED. Peek is pure UI-local state passed
 *                in via `peeked`; this function NEVER mutates `group.folded`.
 *   UNFOLDED   — !folded → an open row; members shown LIVE (with their own per-block fold
 *                state). The wire is uncollapsed; the model now sees the members.
 *
 * The open states are distinguished on the wire-relevant axis by `live`: a `groupOpen`
 * row carries `live=false` for PEEK (folded, dull preview) and `live=true` for UNFOLDED
 * (folded=false, members live). `folded=false` always wins → `live=true`, even if the id
 * is also in `peeked` (you can't peek a group that's already unfolded).
 *
 * Kept pure (no store, no runes) so the layout transform is unit-testable on its own and
 * the component stays thin. Groups are always entirely older than the protected tail, so a
 * group never straddles the grid's older/protected split — callers may safely build over
 * either slice. A group whose first member is absent from the given block list is dropped
 * defensively (its members render as plain blocks rather than as ungrouped strays), which
 * only arises if an invariant is already broken.

/**

 * - `tile`  — a live (non-folded) block → a full square cell.
 * - `fold`  — ONE ungrouped folded block. Folding substitutes the block's content for a
 *             digest, which is a real synthetic "cocoa" block now in the context; the lane
 *             shows that cocoa block plus the original as a thin sliver. Adjacent ungrouped
 *             folds are NEVER merged — each folded block is its own `fold` item (1 cocoa +
 *             1 sliver). Adjacency is not grouping.
 * - `group` — a collapsed ADR-0006 group → ONE shared cocoa summary block + its N member
 *             slivers. A shared summary only ever comes from an explicit group.
 *
 * Tiles-segment rows only contain `block` and `group` rows (open groups are `band`
 * segments, handled separately); `groupOpen` never reaches here.
