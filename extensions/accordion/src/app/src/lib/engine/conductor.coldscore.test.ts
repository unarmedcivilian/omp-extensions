/*
 * conductor.coldscore.test.ts — end-to-end behavioral tests for ColdScoreConductor
 * driven through the real AccordionStore (store.attach / store.refold).
 *
 * Pattern mirrors conductor.test.ts: build a ParsedSession, make a store, attach
 * ColdScoreConductor, and assert on store.isFolded / store.groups / store.liveTokens.
 *
 * What we test:
 *   1. Under-budget → returns [] (raw, nothing folded).
 *   2. Over-budget → folds enough to bring liveTokens ≤ budget (THE BUDGET GUARANTEE).
 *   3. Never folds tool_call, user, human-pinned, or protected-tail blocks.
 *   4. Lexical pre-unfold: old block sharing a distinctive file path with the protected
 *      tail text is kept live while a comparable non-matching block IS folded.
 *   5. Hysteresis: a block pre-unfolded in one pass is not immediately re-folded on the
 *      next pass (within cooldown) when budget still allows.
 *   6. Never emits a group command (auto-coalesce was removed from this conductor).
 *   7. Built-in remains selectable and unaffected after swapping conductors.

// ── 8. Two-pass black-box: pre-unfold+re-fold must NOT write hysteresis ────────
//
// This test pins the bug fixed in the cold-score conductor where the lexical
// pre-unfold step (Step 2b) used to record a recall AND set a cooldown for block X
// IMMEDIATELY upon keeping it live — even though the relaxed pass (Step 4) might
// subsequently RE-FOLD X under budget pressure. The result was that a block that
// ended up FOLDED after pass 1 still carried:
//   (a) a cooldown → shielding it from Step 3's re-clamp in pass 2
//   (b) a recall   → inflating its cold-score activation in pass 2 (warmer = folds later)
//
// The buggy cooldown effect is the most directly observable: on pass 2 the tail again
// references block X. Step 2b sees X is on cooldown (coolUntil > T) and SKIPS the
// pre-unfold entirely. X stays folded. The budget can then be met without touching Y
// (the only other candidate), so Y stays live. With the FIX, X carries no cooldown;
// Step 2b correctly pre-unfolds X; Step 3 folds Y instead to stay within budget; X ends
// up live. The final fold-id sets are disjoint — the two-pass sequence is fully
// deterministic and distinguishes fixed from buggy code.
//
// Pass-1 setup (called via conduct() directly, no store):
//   budget=700, liveTokens=1700
//   X  = tool_result, turn=1, order=0, tokens=500, foldedTokens=10, text has SIGNAL_PATH
//   Y  = tool_result, turn=1, order=1, tokens=500, foldedTokens=10
//   Z  = tool_result, turn=1, order=2, tokens=500, foldedTokens=10
//   P  = text, turn=10, protected, tokens=200, foldedTokens=10, text has SIGNAL_PATH
//
// Step 2a folds X,Y,Z to meet budget (live 1700 → 230 ≤ 700; P stays live, it's protected).
// Step 2b: X is in the fold set and matches P's SIGNAL_PATH → pre-unfolded; live goes back over.
// Step 3: no remaining unfrozen candidates (Y,Z already folded) → nothing.
// Step 4: X is the only non-folded candidate → re-folded. Final fold set = {X,Y,Z}.
// FIX: no recall or cooldown recorded for X (re-folded in relaxed pass).
// BUG: recall[X]=[10] and coolUntil[X]=15 recorded immediately in step 2b.
//
// Pass-2 setup (same instance, same turn T=10):
//   budget=800, liveTokens=1200
//   X  = tool_result, turn=1, order=0, tokens=500, foldedTokens=10, text has SIGNAL_PATH
//   Y  = tool_result, turn=1, order=1, tokens=500, foldedTokens=10
//   P  = text, turn=10, protected, tokens=200, foldedTokens=10, text has SIGNAL_PATH
//
// Step 2a: fold X (coldest/lowest order): live=1200-490=710 ≤ 800. Stop. folded={X}.
// Step 2b:
//   FIX  — coolUntil[X]=0 ≤ T=10 → X is pre-unfolded; live=1200; preUnfolded={X}.

//   BUG  — coolUntil[X]=15 > T=10 → X is skipped in step 2b; preUnfolded={}.
