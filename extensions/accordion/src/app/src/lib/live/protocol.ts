/*
 * protocol.ts — the wire contract between the pi extension and the Accordion GUI.
 *
 * This file is the SINGLE SOURCE OF TRUTH for the live link. It is imported by
 * both the GUI (app/src/lib/live/*) and the pi extension (extension/accordion.ts,
 * via a relative import) so the two can never drift. Keep it dependency-free and
 * types-only at runtime — no imports from the rest of the app.
 *
 * ── Roles (Milestone 1) ────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *   • The pi EXTENSION hosts a WebSocket server on PORT (127.0.0.1).
 *   • The GUI webview connects as a WebSocket CLIENT.
 *   • "GUI drives, extension is thin": the extension never decides what to fold.
 *     It linearizes pi's in-memory messages into blocks, streams them, and applies
 *     whatever fold plan the GUI returns. The GUI runs the engine (the brain).
 *
 * ── Per-turn loop ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *   1. pi's `context` hook fires in the extension (before a model call).
 *   2. Extension sends `sync` with the blocks added since the last sync.
 *   3. GUI updates its live store, runs the engine, replies `plan { ops }`.
 *   4. Extension applies the ops to the real messages and returns them to pi.
 *      If no GUI is connected, or the reply times out, the extension passes the
 *      messages through UNMODIFIED (never corrupts context).
 *
 * Milestone 1 deliberately ships an EMPTY plan (`ops: []`) from the GUI: the loop
 * is proven end-to-end while never altering a single model call.
 */

 * Bump on any breaking change to the message shapes below. History:

 * Provider safety lives on BOTH sides (defense in depth, like `FoldOp`): the extension's

 * durable messages — on ANY doubt the affected messages pass through untouched. The wire
 * trusts the engine's plan (the engine is the single foldability gate and never folds a
