/*
 * conductorClient.svelte.ts — Accordion's side of the conductor wire (ADR 0007).
 *
 * Turns an out-of-process conductor (a WebSocket endpoint) into something the engine can
 * `attach()`: a `RemoteRunner` that implements the in-process `Conductor` interface. The
 * trick is bridging async ↔ sync. The store calls `conduct()` synchronously on every
 * context change and must never block on a model call; the remote answers whenever it
 * likes. So:
 *
 *   - `conduct(snapshot)` PUSHES the snapshot to the remote (fire-and-forget) and returns
 *     the conductor's LAST known desired commands (or `null` = hold) — it never waits.
 *   - When the remote later sends `conductor/commands`, the runner caches them and pokes
 *     the store (`refold()`), which re-enters `conduct()`, reads the fresh cache, and the
 *     host applies it. ClampReports flow back as `host/commandResult`.
 *
 * "GUI drives, conductor is thin" in reverse: here the conductor drives, and this client
 * is the thin adapter that keeps the engine's safety floor (it never bypasses
 * `applyCommands`, which clamps every command to provider-validity).
