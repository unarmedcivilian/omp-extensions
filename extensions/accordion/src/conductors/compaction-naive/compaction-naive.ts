/*
 * compaction-naive.ts — the "Naive compaction" conductor.
 *
 * PURPOSE: This conductor exists as a deliberate BASELINE / FOIL that demonstrates
 * what mainstream AI coding tools do today. When the context approaches capacity,
 * it calls an LLM to summarize the aged history into a single prose summary and
 * presents the agent that one summary IN PLACE of the whole aged region — faithfully
 * reproducing what Cursor's composer, Claude Code's `/compact`, and similar tools do.
 *
 * It is DELIBERATELY LOSSY AND RECURSIVE:
 *   - Lossy: the aged blocks are collapsed into ONE group whose digest is the generated
 *     summary. There is no `{#code FOLDED}` tag on the summary, so the agent cannot call
 *     `unfold` to recover the originals. From the agent's perspective the history is gone
 *     — exactly the mainstream-tool behaviour. The human can always DETACH this conductor
 *     to recover full history (that is Accordion being Accordion), but the agent cannot.
 *     That asymmetry is the whole point.
 *   - Recursive: each subsequent compaction summarizes the PRIOR SUMMARY + only the
 *     newly aged blocks. It never re-reads the originals already compressed. This
 *     self-imposed amnesia compounds quality loss over a session — the exact failure
 *     mode Accordion's reversible folding is designed to avoid.
 *
 * SHAPE — close cousin of the sliding-window conductor. Where sliding-window emits
 * `group(digest: null)` (DROP the aged run from the wire) to keep a live window, this
 * conductor emits `group(digest: <LLM summary>)` (REPLACE the aged run with one summary
 * message). Same single-group-over-the-aged-run shape; only the digest differs. The host
 * snaps the run outward to whole messages and pair-balances `tool_call`/`tool_result`,
 * so no tool result is ever orphaned.
 *
 * TRIGGER — sliding-window-style hysteresis. `view.liveTokens` is the pressure
 * baseline (actual host usage when available, otherwise Accordion's block estimate),
 * so it includes non-foldable overhead as well as the cleared block view. A naive
 * `liveTokens >= 90%` test would re-trigger every pass once first crossed. Instead the
 * conductor tracks the token SAVING its summary group provides and triggers on the VISIBLE
 * window: `visible = liveTokens − (Σ survivor tokens − summary token cost)`.
 * When `visible >= 90%` of budget AND there are newly-aged blocks to fold in, it launches a
 * completion; otherwise it HOLDS, re-emitting the existing summary group. Compacting the
 * newly-aged blocks drops `visible` well below 90%, and the conductor waits for the window
 * to refill before acting again — the same high-water band sliding-window uses.
 *
 * AMNESIA / MONOTONIC COVER. `compactedIds` is the monotonic set of block ids already
 * represented by the summary (the sliding-window `dropped` set's analog — only ever grows
 * within a session). At trigger the conductor feeds the LLM `prior summary + newly-aged
 * originals` only; the originals already compressed are deliberately not re-read. The
 * summary group covers `compactedIds ∩ aged region` — the oldest aged blocks, which (because
 * blocks age in order and `human-steering` keeps the region contiguous) form a single
 * contiguous run → one group, one summary tile.
 *
 * USER MESSAGES ARE PRESERVED VERBATIM inside the summary (Claude-Code `/compact`
 * behaviour): the system prompt instructs the model to reproduce every user message
 * word-for-word in a dedicated section. `user` intent therefore survives compaction
 * intact across the whole session; only assistant reasoning degrades — the faithful foil.
 *
 * All block kinds (`user`, `text`, `thinking`, `tool_call`, `tool_result`) are swallowed
 * by the group. The host's whole-message snap + pair-balance keeps the result wire-valid.
 *
 * No Svelte, no $state, no engine imports. Types only from ../contract.

 * 8k still represents a large reduction (~2.5x at 20k of input, ~25x at 200k) while leaving
 * a useful structured summary.
 *
 * The extension clamps the requested max to the model's own max-output ceiling before
 * sending the API call, and the model enforces it as a hard generation cap — so requesting
 * more than a given model allows is safe (it is clamped, not rejected). If the summary would

 * VERBATIM so the human's intent and instructions survive every compaction intact. Only
 * assistant text/thinking/tool calls/tool results are summarized.
 *
 * The prompt is the FAITHFUL FOIL's voice, so it mirrors what real tools actually do
 * rather than over- or under-specifying:
 *   - A "do NOT continue the conversation" guard (pi's `SUMMARIZATION_SYSTEM_PROMPT`) —
 *     this prevents a non-compaction failure mode (the model answering the conversation
 *     instead of summarizing it); it does NOT reduce the recursive-amnesia loss the foil
 *     is built to demonstrate.
 *   - A `## Relevant files` section (OpenCode has this; pi tracks files via XML tags).
 *     File paths are the #1 artifact lost in recursive compaction, and real tools retain
 *     them, so the foil does too — yet they still degrade across recursive passes because
 *     the model re-summarizes them from the prior summary, never the originals.
 *   - The "(none)" placeholder convention (OpenCode) keeps the structure parseable even
 *     when a section is empty.
 *
 * The format spec lives in the SYSTEM prompt (not the user prompt) because it is identical
 * for the first and recursive passes; only the user-prompt preamble differs (see
 * `buildPrompt`), which carries the recursive merge instructions.

You are a context-compaction assistant. Your task is to read a segment of an AI \
assistant's conversation history and produce a compact, structured briefing that the \
assistant can use to continue working effectively without seeing the original messages.

Do NOT continue the conversation. Do NOT respond to any questions in the conversation. \
ONLY output the structured summary.

USER MESSAGES ARE SACRED. Reproduce EVERY user message VERBATIM, in order, exactly as \
originally written, in the "## User messages" section. Do not paraphrase, abbreviate, \
summarize, or omit a single user message — the human's intent and instructions must \
survive compaction intact. (Assistant text, thinking, tool calls, and tool results ARE \
summarized; only user messages are preserved word-for-word.)

Produce your output in EXACTLY this structure — no prose outside the sections. Keep \
every section even when empty; write "(none)" where nothing applies:

## User messages
Every user message from the summarized segment, reproduced verbatim, in order, each \
clearly separated. If there are no user messages, write "(none)".

## Goal
One sentence: what is the overall task or objective being pursued?

## Progress
Bullet list of what has been accomplished so far. Be specific: files changed, commands \
run, decisions made, errors encountered and resolved.

## Key decisions
Bullet list of the important choices made (architecture, approach, libraries, \
workarounds). Include the reasoning where it matters for future steps.

## Next steps
Bullet list of what is expected to happen next, in the order the work is heading.

## Critical context
Any facts, invariants, or constraints the assistant MUST remember: API keys pattern \
(never actual values), file paths, environment quirks, non-obvious rules from the \
human's instructions, hard constraints on scope. Err on the side of including \
something here if it would be surprising to lose it.

## Relevant files
- {file path}: why it matters. List files that were read, written, or are central to \
the task. Write "(none)" if none.

Be terse everywhere EXCEPT the verbatim user messages, which must be complete. Omit \
pleasantries, meta-commentary, and filler. The output will be placed directly into the \
agent's context window.`;
